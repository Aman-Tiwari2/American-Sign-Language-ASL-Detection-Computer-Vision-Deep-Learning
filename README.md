# American-Sign-Language-ASL-Detection-Computer-Vision-Deep-Learning

This project focuses on detecting and recognizing American Sign Language (ASL) gestures using computer vision and deep learning techniques. It leverages Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to classify hand gestures and translate them into corresponding letters or words.

**ðŸš€ Features**

- Real-time ASL detection using OpenCV & TensorFlow
- Pre-trained deep learning models for accurate gesture classification
- Custom dataset support for training on additional signs

**ðŸ”§ Setup & Usage**
 1. Clone Repository
 2. Install all the important dependencies(cv2, cvzone, tensorflow, numpy, math, time)
 3. Make Sure to use a compatible Python version with all the dependencies.
